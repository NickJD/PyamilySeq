# PyamilySeq
PyamilySeq (Family Seek) is a Python-based tool for clustering gene sequences into families based on sequence similarity identified by tools such as CD-HIT, DIAMOND or MMseqs2.
This work is an extension of the gene family / pangenome tool developed for the StORF-Reporter publication in NAR (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad814).
